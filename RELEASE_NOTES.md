# Release Notes

<!--
Two variants, pick the one that fits this repo's actual unit of change:

1. No version tags yet (pre-1.0, nothing published) — track by PR instead, same way
   AISF does it: one entry per merged PR against main, reverse chronological, each
   linking to its PR and (where one exists) to the doc that covers the change in full
   detail. Use "## PR #N — <summary>" headers.

2. Actual version tags exist — use "## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD" headers instead, each
   linking to the PRs it shipped and a compare link to the previous tag. Add an
   "### Upgrade notes" subsection under any entry with a breaking change.

Either way, keep the tone AISF's file uses: bolded category tags inline in the
bullet (**Added:** / **Changed:** / **Fixed:**), not separate subheaders per
category — and state known limitations or deliberate scope cuts plainly instead of
leaving them implied.

## Repo bootstrap — governance scaffold, Cargo skeleton, migration architecture
**2026-08-17**

- **Added:** standard governance file set (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING,
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, ADR seed, PR/issue
  templates, `.gitattributes`, Rust CI workflow) via `repo-config`.
- **Added:** minimal Cargo skeleton (`src/lib.rs` + `src/main.rs`, single
  crate) so CI has something to build/test/lint against.
- **Added:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` cites `Rusty-Mill/rusty_foundation_akb`
  ADR-0119 (extraction is a validated filesystem transaction) and ADR-0120
  (content identification is evidence, not intrinsic truth) as the governing
  design for this repo's detection/extraction core, rather than inventing an
  architecture from scratch.
- **Known limitation, stated plainly:** this is scaffolding only — no
  extraction logic has been ported yet. Migration scope for this phase is the
  core file-type-detection + extraction-orchestration engine as a Rust
  CLI/library, ported from
  [UniExtract2](https://github.com/mzelivsky-spec/UniExtract2) (AutoIt),
  Windows-only parity, shelling out to the same external helper binaries as
  the source. The GUI, Windows context-menu integration, auto-updater, and
  feedback/telemetry system are explicitly deferred to a later migration
  phase (user decision, 2026-08-17) — see `capability-manifest.md`.
